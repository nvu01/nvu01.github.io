## 🚀 The Curious Analyst

I’m a **curious and driven data analyst** who thrives on tackling challenges and digging beneath the surface of data to uncover meaningful patterns. While my technical foundation lies in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, what truly sets me apart is **how I think** — critically, creatively, and always with an eye toward improvement.

In just one year, I completed a full **4-year bachelor’s degree in Data Analytics** from [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/). That pace wasn’t just about ambition — it was about mindset. I learn quickly, adapt to complexity, and push through ambiguity with persistence and clarity. Whether I’m debugging a machine learning pipeline or distilling a story for business stakeholders, I bring focus, clarity, and energy to everything I do.

## 💡 What I Bring to the Table

- **Critical Thinker**: I ask tough questions, explore alternative hypotheses, and don’t settle for surface-level answers.
- **Fast Learner**: From APIs to ML deployment, I pick up new tools fast — and apply them just as quickly.
- **Communicator**: I translate technical findings into clear, actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders.
- **Collaborator**: My background across HR, operations, and entrepreneurship taught me how to work with cross-functional teams and build bridges between data and action.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools

**Languages & Libraries**: SQL, Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, Seaborn, Matplotlib), R, VBA, HTML
**Tools**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Tableau, Power BI, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, PyCharm  
**Certifications**:  
- CompTIA Data+ (Oct 2024)  
- AWS Cloud Practitioner (July 2024)  
- Udacity ML DevOps (Mar 2025)

## 🌱 Where I'm Headed

Every project is an opportunity to grow. I’m currently exploring:

- Cloud-based data engineering workflows
- Experiment tracking and model governance
- More advanced statistical modeling and causal inference
- Deeper integration of data storytelling into business decisions

I'm excited to continue learning, collaborating, and building solutions that matter.
