## The Curious Analyst

I’m a **curious and driven data analyst** who loves digging into data, asking a million “why’s,” and figuring out how to turn messy data into clear insights. While my technical foundation lies in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, what truly sets me apart is **how I think** critically, creatively, and always looking for ways to make things better.

In just one year, I completed a full 4-year bachelor’s degree in Data Analytics from [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/). No, I didn’t time travel! I just really like learning, figuring things out fast, and getting stuff done.

## What I Bring to the Table

- **Critical Thinker** – I don’t just crunch numbers. I question them (politely).
- **Fast Learner** – New tech? New tools? Challenge accepted.
- **Communicator** – I make sure insights don’t get lost in translation.
- **Team Player** – I’ve collaborated with HR teams, retail ops, and cross-functional partners and ran my own Etsy shop, where I wore every hat from designer to data analyst to customer support.


## Skills & Tools

**Languages & Libraries**: SQL, Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, Seaborn, Matplotlib), Power Query M, R, VBA, HTML  

**Tools**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Tableau, Power BI, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, PyCharm  

**Certifications**:
- CompTIA Project+ (December 2024)
- CompTIA Data+ (October 2024)
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (July 2024)


## Where I'm Headed

Learning never stops and that’s the fun part. Right now I’m leveling up in:

- Cloud-based data workflows and automation
- Expanding my ability to translate data into business insights and decision-making support
- Exploring real-world projects in marketing, finance, healthcare, supply chain and beyond
- Earning new certs (my favorite kind of side quest)
- Building deeper expertise in data engineering workflows like ETL and ELT
