## 🚀 The Curious Analyst

I’m a **curious and driven data analyst** who thrives on tackling challenges and digging beneath the surface of data to uncover meaningful patterns. While my technical foundation lies in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, what truly sets me apart is **how I think** — critically, creatively, and always with an eye toward improvement.

In just one year, I completed a full **4-year bachelor’s degree in Data Analytics** from [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/). That pace wasn’t just about ambition — it was about mindset. I learn quickly, adapt to complexity, and push through ambiguity with persistence and clarity. Whether I’m debugging a machine learning pipeline or distilling a story for business stakeholders, I bring focus, and energy to everything I do.

## 💡 What I Bring to the Table

- **Critical Thinker**: I ask tough questions, explore alternative hypotheses, and don’t settle for surface-level answers.
- **Fast Learner**: From APIs to ML deployment, I pick up new tools fast — and apply them just as quickly.
- **Communicator**: I translate technical findings into clear, actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders.
- **Collaborator**: My background across HR, operations, and entrepreneurship taught me how to work with cross-functional teams and build bridges between data and action.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools

**Languages & Libraries**: SQL, Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, Seaborn, Matplotlib), R, VBA, Power Query M, HTML  

**Tools**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Tableau, Power BI, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, PyCharm  

**Certifications**:
- CompTIA Project+ (December 2024)
- CompTIA Data+ (October 2024)
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (July 2024)


## 🌱 Where I'm Headed

Every project is an opportunity to grow. My current development goals include:

- Cloud-based data engineering workflows
- Expanding my ability to translate data into business insights and decision-making support
- Gaining experience in applied analytics across domains like marketing, finance, healthcare, and supply chain
- Continuing formal training and certification to stay current with industry trends
- Building deeper expertise in data engineering workflows like ETL and ELT

I'm excited to continue learning, collaborating, and building solutions that matter.
